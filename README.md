# unStrava

Manage activity data exported via [Strava](https://www.strava.com/)'s [bulk export](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export#Bulk).

Strava is great. But it always is a good idea to keep your own data under your own control. If that's something that interests you, unStrava is for you. The idea is to provide a platform that people can use to self-host data that's exported from Strava. This is *not* intended as a replacement for Strava, it is intended as an encouragement for people to own their data, and give them some incentives to do it.
